> Project using HTML, CSS and Javascript, consuming an API to display data from each Pokemon, including audio.

### Improvments

  
	I'm gonna continue working on this project and these are some new improvmentes I think would be great:


- [x] Create the first prototype.
- [ ] Implement new cries.
- [ ] Clean source code and change the name of the classes.
- [ ] Responsive web design for mobile.
- [ ] Maybe use another API to only consume cries, or change everything from this new API (https://www.pkmnapi.com/introduction/).
- [ ] Implement new ideas to make it more complete.

  

## 💻 Before starting

  

Please, before starting, check out if everything is correct on this list:


* You ajusted the volume to listen without any damage.

* You are using a PC (this prototype is not responsive yet)

  

## 📫 If you'd like to change something:

You are welcome to help out with any changes you'd like, please let me know so we can discuss :)
